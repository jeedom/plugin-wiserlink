# Wiserlink plugin

The plugin does not have a general configuration.

# Equipment creation 

Each device corresponds to a WiserLink.

The information necessary for its creation is :

-   The Wiser IP address
-   Username (admin by default)
-   Password (admin by default)

# The orders 

Orders are created automatically. We find the power and energy for each channel of the Wiser. We also find the TV news. And we also find the two possible impulse inputs.

You can for each order choose whether or not they will be visible and assign an icon.
